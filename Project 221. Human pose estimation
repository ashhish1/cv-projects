Project 221. Human pose estimation
Description:
Human Pose Estimation involves detecting key points of the human body (e.g., joints like elbows, wrists, knees) from images or video. Itâ€™s used in fitness tracking, motion analysis, gaming, gesture recognition, and more. In this project, weâ€™ll use MediaPipe by Google, which offers a lightweight and fast pose estimation solution.

ðŸ§ª Python Implementation with Comments (using MediaPipe):

# Install dependencies:
# pip install mediapipe opencv-python matplotlib
 
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 
# Initialize MediaPipe pose estimator
mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose
pose = mp_pose.Pose(static_image_mode=True)
mp_drawing = mp.solutions.drawing_utils
 
# Load an image with a person
image_path = "person_pose.jpg"  # Replace with your image
image = cv2.imread(image_path)
rgb_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
 
# Process the image to detect human pose landmarks
results = pose.process(rgb_image)
 
# Draw the landmarks if found
if results.pose_landmarks:
    annotated_image = rgb_image.copy()
    mp_drawing.draw_landmarks(
        annotated_image,
        results.pose_landmarks,
        mp_pose.POSE_CONNECTIONS,  # Draw connections between keypoints
        mp_drawing.DrawingSpec(color=(0, 255, 0), thickness=2, circle_radius=3),
        mp_drawing.DrawingSpec(color=(255, 0, 0), thickness=2)
    )
else:
    annotated_image = rgb_image.copy()
    print("No human pose detected.")
 
# Display the result
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.imshow(annotated_image)
plt.title("Human Pose Estimation")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
What It Does:
This project detects body joints and outlines the human skeleton. It can be used for real-time fitness feedback, sports performance analysis, rehabilitation, and interactive systems like gesture-based gaming or smart mirrors. You can extend it with pose classification (e.g., yoga pose detection) or multi-person tracking.
